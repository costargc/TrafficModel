In this work we studied the base model for traffic flow know as TASEP (Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process) in a uni-dimensional lattice. We also studied the NaSch model first proposed in 1992 by Nagel and Schreckenberg.  In both model, position, velocity, acceleration and the time are treated as discrete variables where the dynamics happens in a one-dimensional lattice with size L where each site can be occupied or empty in a system with N particles. We discuss on the exact solution presented by Derrida in 1993 for the TASEP model and we also show that TASEP and NaSch models are equivalent when the maximum velocity is given by vm= 1. We also explored these models in simulations considering sequential updates and interactions between vehicles and the impact that these considerations have on the flow per density profile diagram.  In conclusion we also we simulated a new model called the Ambulance Model where we considered overtaking dynamics.

This work was presented to the Institute of Physics of the University of Sao Paulo (Brazil) in order to obtain the title of Master of Science.
